    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups lukewarm milk, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1/4 onion, peeled</li>
        <li>1 whole clove</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>9 ounces rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>Pinch of freshly ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>Sea salt and white pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons whole-grain mustard</li>
        <li>3 1/2 ounces Gruyère, parmesan or other hard cheese, grated</li>
        <li>6 ounces mixed enoki or shimeji mushrooms, trimmed and torn into single mushrooms</li>
        <li>Finely chopped fresh parsley for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in a medium frying pan over<br>
            medium heat. Add the flour and mix to form a<br>
            paste, cooking it for 2 minutes. Remove from <br>
            he heat and let cool for 2 minutes, then gradually<br>
            add the milk, whisking continuously.</li>
        <li>Place the pan back over medium heat; add the<br> 
            onion, clove, and bay leaf; and simmer gently<br> 
            for 10 minutes, whisking frequently. If the sauce<br> 
            becomes too thick, whisk in a little more milk<br> 
            1 tablespoon at a time until saucy.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Bring a stockpot of salted water to a boil. Put<br> 
            the pasta in the water and cook for 2 minutes less<br> 
            than the package instructions say.</li>
        <li>Finish the sauce by removing the onion, clove, and<br> 
            bay leaf, then adding the nutmeg and seasoning with<br> 
            salt and white pepper. Stir in the mustard and half<br> 
            the cheese.<br>

            Drain the pasta and arrange the rigatoni pieces upright<br> 
            tightly in four ovenproof dishes; they will look a bit<br> 
            like honeycomb. Pour the sauce over the pasta. Tap the<br> 
            base of the baking dishes to allow the sauce to get between<br>
            the holes, spooning more on if necessary. Place the mushroom<br> 
            stalks into the rigatoni holes, leaving the caps poking out.<br> 
            Sprinkle with the remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the cheese is golden<br> 
                and bubbling. Serve with a sprinkle of finely chopped parsley<br> 
                on top.</li>
    </ol>

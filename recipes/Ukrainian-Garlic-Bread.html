        <p> Yummy and authentic Ukrainian Garlic Bread</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh yeast</li>
            <li>2 ounces warm water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon caster sugar</li>
            <li>Scant 1 cup strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons wet (new) or regular garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sunflower oil, plus extra for oiling</li>
            <li>Lightly beaten duck (or chicken's) egg, to glaze</li>
            <li>fine sea salt</li>
            <li>Half a bunch of parsley, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First make a "sponge," which is a type of yeasty<br> 
                starter. Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the<br> 
                measurement water (make sure it's blood temperature<br> 
                — hot water would kill the yeast!). Add half of the<br> 
                flour and mix roughly. Cover with clingfilm and leave<br> 
                to proof in the refrigerator overnight.</li>
            
            <li>The next morning, add the rest of the flour and 1/2<br> 
                tablespoon of fine sea salt to the starter and knead<br> 
                on a well-floured work surface until the dough is smooth<br> 
                and comes away from your hands easily.</li>
            
            <li>Divide the dough into 8 pieces and shape into round buns.<br> 
                Put them side by side in an oiled round ovenproof dish or<br> 
                a 9 1/2-inch round cake tin, cover and let them prove again,<br> 
                this time in a warm place, until doubled in size. They will<br> 
                join together just like hot cross buns do</li>
            
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425°F. To make the basting oil,<br> 
                simply stir the crushed garlic through the oil with a small<br> 
                pinch of sea salt and let it infuse.</li>
            
            <li>When the pampushki look plump and ready, brush them generously<br> 
                with some beaten egg to glaze and bake them in the oven for<br> 
                20-25 minutes or until they form a glistening golden crust.<br> 
                Take them out and baste them with the garlic oil. Serve<br> 
                immediately.</li>
        </ol>
